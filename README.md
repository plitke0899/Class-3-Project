This is a map of E-Waste collection sites in NYC. I got the data from NYC OpenData here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Electronics-Drop-Off-Locations-in-NYC/wshr-5vic/about_data

I removed the data that was not necessary for marker placement, then manually categorized each site as a business, nonprofit, or public facility, so that people could direct their business to local nonprofits if they so chose
